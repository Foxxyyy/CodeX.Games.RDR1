# CodeX (027)

CodeX implementation for Red Dead Redemption on PC, Nintendo Switch & PS4.

--------------------

You need the main CodeX engine to either run this or compile the source.

--------------------             

When granted access, [download the files](https://github.com/Foxxyyy/CodeX.Games.RDR1/releases/latest) and paste them to the CodeX/Explorer folders, next to the executable.           

UPDATE 027.1.1:                                     
I disabled the ability to view/export lots of resources to XML (those that cannot be reimported or have issues).                       
So far here are all the resources that can be XML edited (resources ends with the `.w` extension)                                     
* WTD (Textures)                                     
* WST/SST/STRTBL (StringTable)                                     
* WFD (Frag Drawable)                                     
* WVD (Visual Dictionary)                                     

Editing will eventually come out for other files.                                     
I am currently also working on a ScriptHook ASI trainer and don't focus much on CodeX.
