# CodeX (025)

Implementation of Red Dead Redemption into CodeX for Nintendo Switch (and potentially PS4/PS5)

--------------------

You need the main engine to either run this or compile the source.     

Some games are also supported (RDR2/GTAIV/GTAV/MP3/etc) with RDR2 being the main project.

More info here: [@dexyfex](https://www.patreon.com/dexyfex) and [CodeWalker discord](https://discord.gg/rgU4SbeR)   

--------------------             

To set up, download the files [here](https://github.com/Foxxyyy/CodeX.Games.RDR1/releases/latest) and paste them in the CodeX/CodeX Explorer folders, next to the executable.

Note that everything is work in progress, including the separated engine. If you want to mod RDR1, consider using this [tool](https://github.com/Foxxyyy/Magic-RDR) instead.
