# CodeX (022)

My implementation of Red Dead Redemption 1 into CodeX targetting the Nintendo Switch version.

You will need the main engine to either run it or compile the source.    
Other games are also supported to some extents (RDR2/GTAIV/GTAV/MP3/etc) with RDR2 being the main project.

They are both available if you subscribe to @dexyfex at https://www.patreon.com/dexyfex    
There's also more infos in the CodeWalker discord : https://discord.gg/rgU4SbeR               
You then only need to put my .dll/.pdb/.strings files from the bin/Debug/net7.0 folder to the CodeX and CodeX Explorer folders

Everything is a work in progress including the seperated engine so if you're new and plan to mod the game you will probably want to use a better working RPF tool for RDR1.

If you want to contribute to this project and the code, you can message me on my Discord #imfoxxyyy :-)
